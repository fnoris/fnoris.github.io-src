Welcome to my blog! I'd like to use this first post as a brief introduction about myself and the reasons behind this blog. I'm a geek. I love everything related to technology and computers, in particular I'm very interested in the security aspect of them. I enjoy experimenting with the latest gadgets, dissecting a clever hack, finding vulnerabilities and break things. And this is where blogging comes into play.

I'm firmly convinced that the best way to learn something is to write things down. By the process of putting my thoughts into words, I can better understand concepts and ideas behind a topic, I can test my knowledge and fix in memory what I learned. Moreover, I like to write. It's always been a passion of mine, one of those things you keep telling yourself you should do more, but never ending up doing. Thus, starting a blog seems like a good move, the best way to kill two birds with one stone: consolidate my memory while practicing writing skills. But this is only half of the story.

Writing a blog is also a good way to give back to the community. I've been reading papers, blogs, and articles for ages, invaluable sources of knowledge and inspiration. Every time I'm in doubt, when I need to solve a problem, or I just want to dive deep into something, I can count on someone's work. A few clicks away, all my desires can find an answer. There are millions of amazing people around the world sharing their expertise, thoughts and opinions, daily and freely. I think it's time for me to stop lurking and join them, to make my humble contribution.

I will focus my posts on anything about security, but from time to time I might write something about a particular book I like (I've already said that I'm an avid reader?), a new clever tool I discovered, an interesting configuration that improved my workflow, or just something I find particularly interesting and worth sharing. In a nutshell, it's a technical blog focused on IT security topics, with some sporadic digression outside the infosec domain.

At this point, I'd like to take a minute to clarify a couple of things. First of all, I don't pretend to be an expert on anything. I'm just a passionate guy who writes about stuff he likes. I get things wrong, I make mistakes, I've got weird or unpopular ideas. But they are my thoughts and my opinions, nothing more. If anyone ever disagrees or knows better than me, please don't be shy and reach out to me. I'll be very pleased to receive your feedback. I'm an eternal student and I think dialogue and constructive criticism are some of the best learning tool available.

I would also like to point out that English is not my primary language - I'm sure it comes as no surprise - so bear with me. I'll make silly mistakes, grammar errors, and I'll put sentences together in a way that could sound weird for some of you. I apologize in advance. I'm still learning, and one of the reasons (yes, another one!) I decided to start blogging is to improve my English. Writing regularly will allow me to improve both my language and writing skills. Or at least I hope so! They said practise leads to perfection, let's give it a try.


With all that said, I think it's time to officially start this new adventure. Thank you for making it so far, I hope you'll enjoy this blog!
